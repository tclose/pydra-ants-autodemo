# This file is used to manually specify the semi-automatic conversion of
# 'nipype.interfaces.ants.segmentation.DenoiseImage' from Nipype to Pydra.
#
# Please fill-in/edit the fields below where appropriate
#
# Inputs
# ------
# dimension : enum
#    This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If not specified, the program tries to infer the dimensionality from the input image.
# input_image : file
#    A scalar image is expected as input for noise correction.
# noise_model : enum
#    Employ a Rician or Gaussian noise model.
# shrink_factor : int
#    Running noise correction on large images can be time consuming. To lessen computation time, the input image can be resampled. The shrink factor, specified as a single integer, describes this resampling. Shrink factor = 1 is the default.
# output_image : file
#    The output consists of the noise corrected version of the input image.
# save_noise : bool
#    True if the estimated noise should be saved to file.
# noise_image : file
#    Filename for the estimated noise.
# verbose : bool
#    Verbose output.
# num_threads : int
#    Number of ITK threads to use
# args : str
#    Additional parameters to the command
# environ : dict
#    Environment variables
#
# Outputs
